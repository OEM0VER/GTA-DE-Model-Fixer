# Uasset-Model-Fixer
A lightweight tool for repairing broken Unreal Engine models `.uasset`/`.uexp` for GTA Trilogy DE and packing/unpacking `.pak` files with drag-and-drop simplicity.

# **Key features include:**

- **Model Repair:** Fixes `.uasset` files with serialization errors using [Hypermodule‚Äôs MeshAibRemover](https://github.com/hypermodule/MeshAibRemover), which itself is powered by [CUE4Parse](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse).

- **PAK Management:**  
  - Drag a **folder** to create an uncompressed `.pak` file.  
  - Drag a **.pak file** to unpack its contents instantly.
  - Files go to the **Desktop**. 

- **Automatic Setup:** Downloads required resources on first launch, ensuring everything works out of the box.  

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Dark-themed window with hover effects, custom fonts, and clickable links to related resources.  

- **Persistent Window Position:** Remembers the last screen and position the app was opened in for consistent workflow.  

- **Integrated Shortcuts:** Quickly create a desktop shortcut for faster access.  

Designed to assist both modders and developers, **Model Fixer** saves time and effort when working with Unreal Engine models and archives, making asset repair and packaging a seamless process.
